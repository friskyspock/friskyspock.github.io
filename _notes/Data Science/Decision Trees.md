Decision trees are built using a heuristic called **recursive partitioning**. This approach is also known as **divide and conquer**.
The algorithm will repeatedly splits data into smaller sets until sets are sufficiently homogeneous.

Some of the Decision trees algorithm are
- [[Random Forest]]
- [[XGBoost]]

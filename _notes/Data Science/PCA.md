# Principal Component Analysis

- Captures low dimensional set of features from high dimensional data with much information as possible
- With fewer variables, visualization improves
- Useful for 3 or higher dimensional data
- PCA is linear orthogonal transformation that tranforms the data to a
new coordinate system such that the greatest variance by any projection
of the data comes to lie on the first coordinate (called the first principal
component), the second greatest variance on the second coordinate, and
so on..

Before PCA, we standardize the data.

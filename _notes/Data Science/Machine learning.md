We can classify every machine learning algorithm can classify into Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforced Learning

## [[Supervised Machine learning]]
In these algorithms, we use labelled input and output data.
Here are algorithms which comes under this
- [[K Nearest Neighbors]]
- [[Linear Regression]]
	- OLS
	- Ridge
	- Lasso
- Linear Classification
	- [[Logistic Regression]]
	- Linear SVM
- [[Naive Bayes]]
- [[Decision Trees]]
	- Random Forests
	- Gradient Boosted Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines
- [[Neural Networks]]


## [[Unsupervised Machine learning]]
Doesn't use labelled data



Every Problem of Prediction can be divided into two main types:
- Regression
- Classification
In the links above we will discuss various algorithms.

## [[Exploratory Data Analysis]]
- Data Cleaning

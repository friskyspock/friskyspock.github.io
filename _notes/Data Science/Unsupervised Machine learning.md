<b>unsupervised transformations</b> of a dataset are algorithms that create a new representation of the data which might be easier for humans or other machine learning algorithms to understand compared to the original representation of the data.

### Dimensionality reduction/Compressing the data
It takes a high-dimensional representation of the data, consisting of many features, and finds a new way to represent this data that summarizes the essential characteristics with fewer features.
- *Finding the parts or components that "make up" the data.*
- *Visualization*

### [[Clustering]]
- Hierarchical
- K-Means
- DBScan
### [[Dimensionality Reduction Techniques]]
- [[PCA]]
- t-SNE
Association Rule
Recommendation System

### Challenges in Unsupervised Learning
- Evaluating whether the algorithm learned something useful.

      <p>that often considers homogeneous weak learners, learns them independently from each
        other in parallel and combines them following some kind of deterministic averaging process</p>
      <h4 id="boosting">Boosting</h4>
      <p>that often considers homogeneous weak learners, learns them sequentially in a very
        adaptative way (a base model depends on the previous ones) and combines them following a
        deterministic strategy</p>
      <h4 id="stacking">Stacking</h4>
      <p>that often considers heterogeneous weak learners, learns them in parallel and combines
        them by training a meta-model to output a prediction based on the different weak models predictions</p>

      <p>Sampling with replacement
        Sampling without replacement</p>
      <h2 id="random-forest"><a class="internal-link" href="/note/Random-Forest">Random Forest</a></h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Random sampling of training data points when building trees</li>
        <li>Random subsets of features considered when splitting nodes
          training data is sampling is done with replacement</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Random Forest Pseudocode</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Randomly select 'k' features from total 'm' features</li>
        <li>Among 'k' calculate node 'd' using best split point</li>
        <li>Split node into <em>daughter nodes</em> using best split</li>
        <li>Repeat <strong>1 to 3</strong> steps until 'i' numbers of nodes are reached</li>
        <li>Build the forest by repeating steps <strong>1 to 4</strong> for 'n' times to create n trees</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Advantages of Random Forest algorithm</p>
      <ul>
        <li>can be used for both regression and classification</li>
        <li>will handle missing values internally</li>
        <li>overfitting problem will never come in any classification problem</li>
        <li>can be used for feature engineering</li>
      </ul>

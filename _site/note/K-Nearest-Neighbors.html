        <h4 id="bias-training-error">Bias: Training Error</h4>
        <p>Bias is difference between our actual and predicted values.
          When bias is too high, assumptions made by our model are too basic, model couldn't capture the important features of our data. 
          Basically this is Underfitting</p>
        <h4 id="variance-testing-error">Variance: Testing Error</h4>
        <p>Variance is the very opposite of Bias. During training, it allows our model to 'see the data
          a certain number of times to find patterns in it. If it does not work on the data for long
          enough, it will not find patterns and bias occurs.
          We can define variance as the model's sensitivity to fluctuations in the data. Our model
          may learn from noise. This will cause our model to consider trivial features as important</p>
